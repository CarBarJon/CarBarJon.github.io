I am a genome scientist with an interest in investigating biological, evolutionary, and medical questions using computational and statistical methods from population genetics and genetic epidemiology. I like photography, surrealist paintings, and good-looking cocktails, I also love rats; one of my dreams is to have a pet rat named Bojack.
